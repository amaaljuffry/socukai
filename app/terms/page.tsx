                <strong>KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA</strong> â€“ In response to the evolving digital landscape and to ensure robust legal clarity for its users, an enhanced Terms of Service document has been crafted for Socukai.my, an online tax information service. The new terms, which supersede the previous version, incorporate key provisions from Malaysian law, including the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) 2010, the Electronic Commerce Act 2006, and the Consumer Protection Act 1999, to provide a more comprehensive and compliant user agreement.

                The updated document, presented below, offers greater detail on user rights and responsibilities, data privacy, and the specific limitations of the service. It is designed to be clearer and more protective for all parties involved.
